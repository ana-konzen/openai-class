  "setting": "The game is set within a sprawling, ancient, and mystical library known for hiding countless secrets from different realms and times. Rumor has it that hidden deep within its stone walls is a forbidden book penned by a primordial mage whose knowledge could grant its reader limitless wisdom and power. Each chamber in this labyrinthine library is enchanted to test the ingenuity and wit of any who dare to unravel the mystery and claim the prize.",
  "mystery": "An ancient spell cast a long time ago is causing a slow decay of reality, where dreams and nightmares start to merge into the world, threatening existence. The mystery involves unraveling this spell and finding out who actually authored it long ago — and why. Each character in the chambers holds fragments of the truth about the origins of this spell, who cast it, and how it can be undone.",
  "finalPrize": "The final prize is the Forbidden Tome of Eternity, a book that contains the true name of the primordial mage and the spells needed to both harness and reverse the spell’s effects, restoring balance to the world.",
