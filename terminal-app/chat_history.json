    "Welcome, brave adventurer, to the fabled kingdom of Eldoria—a once-prosperous realm now gripped by shadows and uncertainty. A chilling crime has thrust the land into despair: the theft of the Celestial Crown, the mystical artifact upon which the kingdom's well-being and wisdom depend. The theft has remained an enigma, with the kingdom's brightest minds baffled by how such a breach could occur within the heart of the sanctum. It is in this time of darkness that Eldoria looks to you, a worthy and fearless soul, to uncover the truth.\n\nYour journey begins within the ancient Chambers of Resonance, each holding secrets integral to solving the mystery of the stolen crown.

Your task is to interact with these characters, convince them of your worth, and gather crucial information that will lead you closer to the identity and motive of the thief.\n\nEach character you encounter is an intertwined piece of the elaborate puzzle—ask the right questions, give insightful answers, and be mindful of the whispers of the past and present they share. Only by obtaining the keys to each chamber from these characters will you unlock the path to the next.\n\nEmbark on this dialogue-driven odyssey and restore peace to Eldoria. Unearth the secrets and claim the Celestial Crown to be hailed as the Royal Protector. Good luck, and may wisdom guide your quest.",
