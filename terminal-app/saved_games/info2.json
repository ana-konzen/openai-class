  "setting": "In the ancient and forgotten city of Eldra, a hushed whisper persists among its ruined halls. Long abandoned by its inhabitants after whispers of a curse spread, Eldra sits cloaked in mystical fog, hiding relics of untold power. Adventurers seeking fame and fortune venture into its depths, drawn by the promise of a legendary artifact â€“ the Eternal Lumina, said to reveal the secrets of the universe. Lush greenery reclaims much of the city's architecture, creating an eerie, yet beautiful, maze.",
