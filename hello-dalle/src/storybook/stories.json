      "text": "Page 1: Once upon a time in the wibbly-wobbly waters of the ocean, there lived a dolphin named Bob who loved to wear mismatched flip-flops on his fins. Bob had a fondness for making fishy faces and blowing bubble mustaches, his favorite being the \"curly-whirly handlebar.\" Every morning, he hosted the most absurd underwater fashion shows, debuting new seaweed wigs and clam-shell sunglasses for giggling starfish judges. One day, Bob decided to organize a sea-snail race using lettuce leaves as racecars, only to hilariously realize that snails are incredibly slow drivers! Needless to say, life under the sea was never dull with Bob around. Page 2: One sunny morning, while Bob was perfecting his latest bubble mustache, he noticed a graceful dolphin named Luna gliding through the wibbly-wobbly waters. Luna had a shimmering tail that sparkled like a thousand tiny stars, and she wore perfectly paired coral anklets on her fins. Intrigued by her elegance, Bob invited Luna to join his underwater fashion show. Together, they created the most whimsical spectacle the ocean had ever seen, with Luna designing seaweed tiaras that complemented Bob's quirky wigs. As the starfish judges applauded, Bob and Luna exchanged shy smiles, their friendship blossoming into something truly special.",
