#### Instructions:

1. **Cook the Rice:**
   - Rinse 1 cup of rice under cold water.
   - In a medium saucepan, combine the rice with 2 cups of water and a pinch of salt.
   - Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for about 15 minutes or until the water is absorbed and the rice is tender.
   - Remove from heat and let it sit covered for an additional 5 minutes.

2. **Prepare the Vegetables:**
   - While the rice is cooking, heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat.
   - Add the chopped fresh vegetables and sauté until they are tender but still crisp, about 5-7 minutes.
   - Season with salt and black pepper to taste. Remove from the skillet and set aside.

3. **Cook the Salmon:**
   - Season the salmon fillets with salt and black pepper.
   - In the same skillet, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon of olive oil over medium-high heat.
   - Add the salmon fillets, skin-side down, and cook for 4-5 minutes on each side until the salmon is cooked through and flakes easily with a fork.
   - Remove the salmon from the skillet and set aside.

4. **Make the Creamy Lemon Garlic Sauce:**
   - In the same skillet, melt 2 tablespoons of butter over medium heat.
   - Add the chopped onion and minced garlic, and sauté until the onion is translucent and fragrant.
   - Stir in 1 cup of milk and bring to a simmer.
   - Add the lemon zest and juice, and season with salt and black pepper to taste.
   - Let the sauce simmer for a few minutes until it thickens slightly.
   - Stir in 1-2 tablespoons of chopped fresh parsley.

5. **Combine and Serve:**
   - Return the cooked vegetables to the skillet and toss to coat them with the creamy lemon garlic sauce.
   - Serve the salmon fillets over a bed of rice, topped with the creamy lemon garlic vegetables.
   - Garnish with additional fresh parsley if desired.
