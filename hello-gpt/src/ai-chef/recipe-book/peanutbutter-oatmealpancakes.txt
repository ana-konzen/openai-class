Based on the items you have in your pantry, I suggest making **Peanut Butter Oatmeal Pancakes** for dinner. It's a savory-sweet option that can be quite satisfying and doesn't require any additional ingredients beyond what you have.

### Peanut Butter Oatmeal Pancakes

#### Ingredients:
- 1 cup oats
- 1 cup milk
- 1 cup flour
- 2 eggs
- 2 tbsp butter (melted)
- 2 tbsp peanut butter
- 2 tbsp chocolate powder (optional, for a chocolatey twist)

#### Instructions:
1. **Prepare the Oats:** In a bowl, combine the oats and milk. Let it sit for about 10 minutes to allow the oats to soften.

2. **Mix Dry Ingredients:** In a separate bowl, mix the flour and chocolate powder (if using).

3. **Combine Wet Ingredients:** In another bowl, beat the eggs and then add the melted butter and peanut butter. Mix until well combined.

4. **Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients:** Add the softened oats and milk mixture to the wet ingredients bowl. Gradually add the dry ingredients, mixing until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.

5. **Cook the Pancakes:**
   - Heat a skillet or griddle over medium heat and lightly grease it with a little butter or sesame oil.
   - Pour 1/4 cup of batter onto the skillet for each pancake. Cook until bubbles start to form on the surface and the edges look set, then flip and cook the other side until golden brown.

6. **Serve:** Stack the pancakes on a plate and, if you like, top with a bit more peanut butter, a drizzle of melted butter, or even a sprinkle of chocolate powder.

Enjoy your hearty and flavorful Peanut Butter Oatmeal Pancakes for dinner! If you find you need something a bit more savory, you might want to consider a shopping trip for additional ingredients.
