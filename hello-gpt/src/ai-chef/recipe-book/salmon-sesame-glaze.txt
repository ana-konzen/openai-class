Given the items you have in your pantry, a savory meal seems more appropriate for lunch. Let's make **Salmon with Sesame Soy Sauce Glaze** and a side of **Oatmeal Peanut Butter Cookies** for a touch of sweetness.

### Salmon with Sesame Soy Sauce Glaze

#### Ingredients:
- Salmon
- Soy sauce
- Sesame oil
- Butter

#### Instructions:
1. **Prepare the Salmon:**
   - Rinse the salmon fillets and pat them dry with a paper towel.
   
2. **Make the Glaze:**
   - In a small bowl, mix 2 tablespoons of soy sauce and 1 tablespoon of sesame oil.
   
3. **Cook the Salmon:**
   - Heat a pan over medium-high heat and add 1 tablespoon of butter.
   - Once the butter has melted and the pan is hot, place the salmon fillets skin-side down if they have skin.
   - Cook for about 3-4 minutes on one side, then flip and cook for another 3-4 minutes, or until the salmon is cooked through and flakes easily with a fork.
   - During the last minute of cooking, pour the soy sauce and sesame oil mixture over the salmon. It will caramelize slightly and create a tasty glaze.

4. **Serve:**
   - Remove the salmon from the pan and place it on a serving plate. Drizzle any remaining glaze from the pan over the top.

### Oatmeal Peanut Butter Cookies

#### Ingredients:
- Oats
- Peanut butter
- Eggs
- Flour
- Butter
- Chocolate powder
- Milk (optional, for a softer texture)

#### Instructions:
1. **Preheat the Oven:**
   - Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C).
   
2. **Mix Wet Ingredients:**
   - In a large bowl, combine 1/2 cup of peanut butter, 1/4 cup of melted butter, and 1 egg. Mix until smooth.
   
3. **Add Dry Ingredients:**
   - Add 1 cup of oats, 1/2 cup of flour, and 2 tablespoons of chocolate powder to the wet mixture. Stir until everything is well combined. If the mixture is too thick, you can add a splash of milk to reach your desired consistency.
   
4. **Shape and Bake:**
   - Drop spoonfuls of the dough onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Flatten them slightly with the back of a spoon.
   - Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are golden.
   
5. **Cool:**
   - Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.
