Certainly! Based on the items in your pantry, I suggest making **Chocolate Peanut Butter Oatmeal Cookies**. These are sweet and should satisfy your dessert craving. Here's a simple recipe:

### Chocolate Peanut Butter Oatmeal Cookies

#### Ingredients:
- 1 cup oats
- 1/2 cup flour
- 1/2 cup butter (softened)
- 1/2 cup peanut butter
- 1/2 cup milk
- 1/2 cup chocolate powder
- 2 eggs
- 1/2 cup sugar (if you have any, or you can make the cookies less sweet without it)

#### Instructions:
1. **Preheat the Oven**: Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C).

2. **Prepare the Wet Ingredients**:
   - In a large mixing bowl, combine the softened butter and peanut butter. Mix until smooth and creamy.
   - Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition.
   - Pour in the milk and mix until combined.

3. **Add the Dry Ingredients**:
   - In a separate bowl, combine the oats, flour, and chocolate powder.
   - Gradually add the dry mixture to the wet mixture, stirring until everything is well combined.

4. **Sweeten (Optional)**:
   - If you have sugar and prefer sweeter cookies, add 1/2 cup sugar to the wet ingredients before combining them with the dry ingredients.

5. **Shape the Cookies**:
   - Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or lightly grease it.
   - Scoop tablespoons of the dough onto the baking sheet, spacing them about 2 inches apart.

6. **Bake**:
   - Bake in the preheated oven for 12-15 minutes or until the edges are lightly browned.
   - Remove from the oven and allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.
