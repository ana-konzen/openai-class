2. **Prepare the Salmon**:
   - Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.
   - Season the salmon fillets with salt and black pepper.
   - Cook the salmon fillets in the skillet for about 4-5 minutes per side, or until fully cooked and flaky.

   - Add the bell pepper slices and broccoli florets, and sauté for another 5 minutes until they start to soften.
   - Add the cherry tomatoes (or chopped tomatoes) and spinach, and cook until the spinach wilts and the tomatoes soften, about 3 minutes.

4. **Combine Everything**:
   - Add the cooked pasta to the skillet with the vegetables.
   - Zest the lemon over the pasta and squeeze in its juice.
   - Add the flaked salmon chunks and toss everything together gently to combine.
